    <abstract>
      <para>This EDI data package contains instructional materials necessary to teach Macrosystems EDDIE Module 9: Using High-Frequency Data to Improve Water Quality, a ~3-hour educational module for undergraduates. Many water management decisions come with tradeoffs. One important example of such a decision is the use of chlorine in the drinking water treatment process. Chlorination is an important disinfection step in water treatment and is needed to protect water consumers from harmful pathogens (such as bacteria). However, when there are high amounts of organic matter in the raw water, chlorination can result in the formation of potentially cancer-causing disinfection byproducts. Environmental sensor data on water quality conditions, such as organic matter measurements from drinking water reservoirs, can help inform water management decision-making and reduce the risk of unintended consequences due to use of chlorine in water treatment. To introduce water treatment students to the use of high-frequency data to inform their management decision-making, we created a short (one- to three-hour) module which develops key skills in high-frequency data visualization and interpretation. In this module, students explore organic matter data collected from drinking water reservoirs and learn how to interpret these data to inform their decision-making about chlorination during drinking water treatment, using data from the Virginia Reservoirs Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program. This module was created as part of a virtual, asynchronous curriculum for community college students training to become drinking water treatment plant operators, and could also be taught in high school or introductory undergraduate environmental science and natural resource management courses. The module is designed to be flexible for use in-person, hybrid, and virtual, asynchronous course formats. Students complete module activities using an R Shiny web application which can be accessed from an internet browser on a computer. The R Shiny application is published to shinyapps.io and is available at the following link: https://macrosystemseddie.shinyapps.io/module10/. A GitHub repository is available for the R Shiny application code (https://github.com/MacrosystemsEDDIE/module10), and the code repository has been published with a DOI to Zenodo (ADD ZENODO DOI HERE). This data package includes open source versions of module introductory lecture slides, a student handout, and an instructor manual which can be used to teach the module. Readers are referred to the module landing page for additional information (https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/teaching_materials/modules/module10.html). </para>

          <para>MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING</para>
          <para>Module teaching materials were developed by M.E. Lofton, R.L. Cooke, and C.C. Carey to provide instructors with a ready-to-use, adaptable module that could be implemented in a 1-3 hour time period to introduce students to use of high-frequency data to inform decision-making in drinking water treatment. </para>
          <para>As the tenth module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was developed to introduce students to use of high-frequency water quality data inform decision-making in drinking water treatment. In this module, students will explore high-frequency water quality data from a drinking water reservoir and use these data to make decisions about chlorination for disinfection while mitigating the risk of disinfection byproduct formation. This module will teach students to interpret high-frequency water quality data; how water quality variables change over time in reservoirs located in temperate regions; and how water quality data can be used to inform water treatment decision-making. </para>
          <para>The learning goals for this module are that students will be able to:: </para>
          <para>- Define what disinfection byproducts are.  </para>
          <para>- Describe the environmental and water treatment processes that influence the formation of disinfection byproducts. </para>
          <para>- Understand the trade-offs between disinfection and byproduct formation that can occur when chlorinating water, and treatment techniques that can be used to manage these tradeoffs (e.g., coagulation, activated carbon filters).  </para>
          <para>- Use environmental data visualizations to identify when additional treatment techniques to avoid disinfection byproduct formation should be used to meet water quality objectives.  </para>
          <para>
MODULE WORKFLOW</para>
          <para>Workflow for this module:</para>
          <para>1. The instructor chooses whether to deliver the module using the Canvas Learning Management System or not. If using Canvas, the instructor should import the module to their course from the Canvas commons (https://lor.instructure.com/resources/11eff0d9772847b6ac57208f04942351). If not using Canvas, all module materials can be accessed from this web page: https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/teaching_materials/modules/module10.html.   </para>
          <para>2. Students view a short (~10 minute) introductory video either in Canvas or in the R Shiny web application. The same video is linked from both locations. Alternatively, instructors may choose to modify the introductory PowerPoint presentation and present it themselves. An editable version of the slides is provided with the teaching materials below.  </para>
          <para>3. Students navigate to the R Shiny web application and follow the workflow instructions outlined on the Introduction tab:</para>
          <para>a. Watch the introductory presentation provided in Canvas and embedded in the interactive R Shiny web application if you have not already done so.</para>
          <para>b. Watch the "Guide to Module" video embedded in the interactive R Shiny web application to learn about key features of the module that will help you complete module activities and answer questions. Optionally, you can also go through the "Quick-start" guide to the module using the button at the top right corner of the module web page.</para>
          <para>c. Select a focal reservoir.</para>
          <para>d. Open the Canvas quiz questions associated with the reservoir you have chosen OR if you are not using Canvas, download a copy of all the questions as a Word document by clicking the "Download student handout" button within the Shiny app.</para>
          <para>e. Work through the module to complete the Introduction questions and Activities A, B, and C in this web app. When you are prompted to answer questions, enter your answers in the Canvas quiz. Be sure to fill in the Canvas quiz that corresponds to the reservoir site you have chosen! If you are not completing the module using Canvas, you may type your answers into the Word document.</para>
          <para>f. If you would like to take a break and come back later, or if you lose internet connection, all you have to do is re-load this web app, re-select your reservoir site in the Introduction, and you will be able to resume your progress. On Canvas, you can save your quiz responses using the "Save" button. In Word, you can save your answers in the document on your computer.</para>
          <para>g. When you have finished the module activities, be sure to submit your Canvas quiz for grading. If you are completing the module by answering the questions in a Word document, be sure to submit the document to your instructor for grading.</para>
          <para>4. The instructor can choose how to assess student module question responses. If using the Canvas quiz, all self-grading questions are worth 1 point by default, and short answer questions are worth 0 points. The point values may be adjusted by the instructor. If using the Word document, point values are not assigned to questions; this is left to the discretion of the instructor.</para>
